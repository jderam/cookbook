# Japanese Curry (Gluten-Free)

## Ingredients
- 2-3 lbs chicken breast or thighs, cut into large chunks
- 4 yellow potaoes, cut into large chunks
- 6 carrots, cut into large chunks
- 2 red onions
  - one finely diced
  - one sliced into strips
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- equal amount minced ginger
- tomato paste
- 1 quart chicken stock
- oil (coconut, avocado, vegetable)
- roux
  - 4 tbsp butter
  - 2 tbsp rice flour
  - 2 tbsp corn starch
- 4 tbsp curry powder (can probably use less)
- 1 tsp garam masala
- salt

## Instructions
1. In a large pot or dutch oven, heat some oil at medium-high. Salt and pepper the chicken, then brown it. Set the browned chicken aside.
2. Add more oil to the pot if needed, and cook the diced onions until they are soft (10ish minutes).
3. Add the garlic and ginger and cook 1 minute.
4. Add a spoon of tomato paste and cook 2-3 minutes. Add a bit of stock if needed to prevent sticking/burning.
5. Add potatoes, carrots, and chicken to the pot. Add chicken stock until ingredients are covered. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to med-low and simmer for the next 15-20 minutes while you're preparing the roux.
6. In a pan on low heat, combine the butter, rice flour, and corn starch. Continue mixing over low heat for about 10 minutes until incorporated and thickened. It should be a rich yellow color. Do not try to brown.
7. Add the curry powder and garam masala to the roux. Mix it in for about 2-3 minutes. Add tomato paste to thicken. Add stock to thin and keep from burning.
8. Once the roux is ready, add it to the pot. Add salt as desired (start with 2-3 tbsp and add more at the end of needed).
9. Add some oil to the pan that was used to make the roux. Sautee the sliced onions a bit, then add them to the pot.
10. Continue simmering until chicken, potatoes, and carrots are all cooked, and curry has thickened.
11. Remove from heat and serve with jasmine rice.
